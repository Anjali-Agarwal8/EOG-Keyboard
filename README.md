# eog-based-virtual-keyboard
EOG(Electrooculogram) based virtual keyboard can assist people with motor neuron disease to communicate effectively. EOG signal is obtained from corneo-retinal standing potential that exists between the front and the back of the human eye. It can be extracted by placing electrodes around the eye which can pick up these signals. 


This repository includes the code to classify the filtered signal and GUI for the virtual keyboard developed in MATLAB.
